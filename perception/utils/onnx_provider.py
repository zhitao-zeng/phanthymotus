utils/onnx_provider.py — Validate a device choice and pick the weights for it.

The plugin config exposes `device: auto | cpu | gpu`; plugins/asr.py resolves
`auto` to a concrete device before this module is called. `ASR_MODELS` there
declares, per model, which weights each device loads. This module does not decide
*what* to run — the registry does — it decides whether a (device, weights) pair is
allowed to run, and helps adapters find the right file.

Everything here encodes a measured failure mode. All numbers are from orin5
(Orin NX, JetPack 5.11, CUDA 11.4, 6 cores) with sherpa-onnx 1.13.6+cuda, on an
idle box (services stopped, idle GR3D verified 0%), swept across 1/2/4
`num_threads`, reporting the steady-state median:

| model                                 | dtype | CPU t=2 | CUDA t=2 | ratio  |
|---------------------------------------|-------|---------|----------|--------|
| streaming paraformer (30.7 s audio)   | int8  | 3295 ms |  8394 ms |  0.39x |
| streaming paraformer                  | fp32  | 8702 ms |  1859 ms |  4.68x |
| streaming paraformer                  | fp16  |42890 ms |  2077 ms | 20.65x |
| X-ASR beam search (28.7 s audio)      | int8  | 2645 ms |  3294 ms |  0.80x |
| offline SenseVoice (28.7 s audio)     | int8  | 1996 ms |  2753 ms |  0.73x |
| offline SenseVoice                    | fp32  | 4792 ms |   416 ms | 11.52x |
| offline SenseVoice                    | fp16  | 8117 ms |   344 ms | 23.60x |
| Matcha TTS (13.3 s audio)             | fp32  | 1784 ms |   416 ms |  4.28x |

Three things follow, and they are the three rules below:

1. **int8 loses on the GPU, always.** ONNX Runtime's CUDA provider has no kernels
   for quantised ops, so it partitions the graph and falls back to CPU node by
   node, adding a host<->device copy at every boundary. Confirmed two ways: fp32
   and fp16 on CUDA are completely insensitive to CPU thread count (417/416/415
   and 343/344/346 ms) with GR3D pinned at 95-97%, while int8 on CUDA scales with
   CPU threads (3793 -> 2753 -> 1905 for SenseVoice). int8 on CUDA is also numerically noisier —
   requantising at every partition boundary changed 3 of 4 SenseVoice transcripts
   versus the same model on CPU, including `不然` -> `主然`.

2. **fp16 loses on the CPU, catastrophically.** ONNX Runtime has no fp16 CPU
   kernels and casts everything: 42890 ms where int8 took 3295 ms.

3. **Neither speed nor self-consistency proves a pair works.** Streaming
   paraformer fp16 on CUDA was fast (2077 ms), identical across all three thread
   counts, and created a session without complaint — while emitting nothing but
   `</s>`. The same fp16 file on CPU transcribed correctly, so the conversion was
   fine and the CUDA+fp16+streaming combination is not. That is why every
   (model, device) entry in ASR_MODELS must have had its *output read* before
   being listed, and why this module can only catch the mechanical mistakes below,
   not that one.

`int16` is not a middle ground worth trying: ONNX Runtime's int16 quantisation is
newer than int8, the CUDA provider has no kernels for it either, and the CPU side
lacks the dot-product paths that make int8 fast.

**gpu costs memory, and most of it is unreturnable.** The historical JP5 fp16
experiment measured with only ASR resident:

    cpu (int8)  build +542 MB, back to  129 MB after the adapter is dropped
    gpu (fp16)  build +1968 MB, still  1516 MB after the adapter is dropped

The residue is the CUDA context and its memory pool. The admitted final split is
therefore JP6 fp32 CUDA (about 1.15 GiB process HWM on the 70-case run) and JP5
int8 CPU (about 0.47 GiB). `device: auto` applies that policy; JP5's image does not
install a CUDA sherpa-onnx wheel.

**And the first gpu inference is the expensive one.** 1659 ms against a 58 ms
steady state: lazy kernel loading, cuDNN autotuning and the memory pool all land
on it. plugins/asr.py warms the adapter up with one second of silence after
building so an operator never pays that on a real utterance.
