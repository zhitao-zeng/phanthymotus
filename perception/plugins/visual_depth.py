plugins/visual_depth.py — VideoDepthPerceptionPlugin: monocular depth from a plain RGB camera.

Subscribes to image/jpeg topics, runs a prebuilt YOLO26-depth TensorRT engine,
and publishes two things per frame:

    {input}/visual_depth          image/depth-zlib   for the dashboard's renderer
    {input}/visual_depth_summary  data/json          for the agent

Named after the tool, not after what they carry — see output_topics_for for why
`{input}/depth` could not stay.

Most robots in this fleet carry only an RGB camera — the RealSense on the
Realman RM75 is the exception — so this gives the rest a depth map without new
hardware.

Two constraints worth knowing before changing anything here:

* **640x480 is not a suggestion.** agent-core's DepthZlibRenderer
  (web/js/renderers/camera.js) hardcodes a 640x480 canvas and returns early
  when the decompressed buffer is shorter than 640*480 samples. A depth map
  published at the model's native resolution renders as a blank panel with
  nothing logged anywhere. Everything is resampled to 640x480 before publishing.

* The indoor YOLO26-S engine emits metres directly and takes stretched RGB
  images in [0, 1]. Its metric transformation is included in the export.
  The optional cal_a/cal_b site calibration remains separate and defaults to
  identity. A site's calibration must be measured for that camera.
